Evaliphy is a end-to-end testing solution for evaluating AI aplications. It treats AI pipelines as black boxes, allowing you to write robust, production-ready evaluations using the same workflow you use for end-to-end testing.

If you can write a Playwright or Vitest test, you can evaluate AI.

[Documentation](https://evaliphy.com)

## ✨ Key Features

- **Playwright-Style API**: Fluent, chainable assertions that feel natural to QA engineers.
- **Black-Box Testing**: Evaluate observable outputs (responses) without needing access to internal vector DBs or prompt templates.
- **LLM-as-a-Judge**: Built-in, production-grade evaluators for Faithfulness, Relevance, Groundedness, and more.
- **CI/CD Ready**: Runs in your existing pipelines and produces structured reports your whole team can read.
- **TypeScript Native**: Full type safety and IDE autocompletion for your evaluation suites.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install & Initialize

```bash
npm install -g evaliphy
npx evaliphy init my-eval-project
cd my-eval-project
npm install
```

### 2. Write Your First Eval

Create a file like `chat.eval.ts`:

```typescript
import { evaluate, expect } from 'evaliphy';

evaluate("Customer Support Bot", async ({ httpClient }) => {
  const query = "What is the return policy?";
  
  // 1. Hit your real RAG endpoint
  const res = await httpClient.post('/api/chat', { message: query });
  const { answer, context } = await res.json();

  // 2. Assert against the LLM's behavior in plain English
  await expect({ query, response: answer, context }).toBeFaithful();
  await expect({ query, response: answer, context }).toBeRelevant({threshold: 0.9});
});
```

### 3. Run the Evals

```bash
npx evaliphy eval
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Evaliphy is configured via an `evaliphy.config.ts` file in your project root. Use the `defineConfig` helper for full TypeScript support and autocompletion.

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'evaliphy';

export default defineConfig({
  // 1. Configure your RAG API
  http: {
    baseUrl: 'https://api.your-service.com',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.API_KEY}`
    }
  },

  // 2. Setup the LLM Judge
  llmAsJudgeConfig: {
    model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
    provider: {
      type: 'openai',
      apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
    }
  },

  // 3. Reporting
  reporters: ['console', 'html']
});
```

## 🧠 Why Evaliphy?

### It fits where your tests already live.
Eval files sit in your repo alongside your other tests. No Python notebooks, no complex ML metrics, and no brittle manual testing.

### You test your real API.
Evaliphy makes HTTP calls to your actual running service. If your RAG system breaks in production, Evaliphy catches it the same way your E2E tests catch a broken UI.

### The judges are built-in.
Faithfulness, relevance, groundedness — the assertions that matter are shipped with the framework. No prompt writing or LLM wiring required.

## 🛠 How it Works

Evaliphy uses an **LLM-as-a-Judge** workflow to provide objective, repeatable scores for subjective AI outputs.

1. **Data Submission**: Your query, response, and context are sent to a high-capability judge model.
2. **Scoring**: The judge evaluates the input against a specialized rubric (0.0 - 1.0).
3. **Thresholding**: If the score meets your threshold (default 0.7), the test passes.
